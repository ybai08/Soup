"""Tier 2, asynchronous: the base stays on NVMe and a background thread reads it.

The shipped ``DiskSource`` calls ``safe_open(...).get_tensor`` from
``LayerBufferPool.load_async``, which is only "async" about the copy to the GPU:
the read happens on the COMPUTE thread before the copy is enqueued, so the
Python thread blocks, the GPU starves, and the starvation shows up as wall time
rather than as a stall. Measured cold on a 36 GB 70B-shaped store: 0.57 GB/s
average and 22 MB/s at worst, from a drive that reads 3.5+ GB/s.

This source reads ahead on its own thread into pre-allocated pinned host
buffers, so ``get`` is a handoff. It never memory-maps: a mapping charges
Windows commit for the file's whole size (#926), and holding one per decoder
layer costs ~35 GB of charge for a 70B run.

``get(idx, name)`` keeps the interface ``RamSource`` and ``DiskSource`` share,
so the prefetcher and the layer wrapper are untouched and the v0.72.0
correctness gates carry over rather than being re-derived. ONE call is added
rather than kept: ``release(idx, event)``. A reusable staging buffer is exactly
what the other two sources do not have — ``RamSource`` holds every layer for the
whole run and ``DiskSource`` returns a freshly allocated tensor per call, so
neither can be recycled underneath an in-flight copy. This source can, and out
of PINNED host memory ``dst.copy_(..., non_blocking=True)`` is still draining
when ``load_async`` returns while ``pool.wait`` is a GPU-side ``wait_event``
that does not block the Python thread at all. Measured through the real pool
before ``release`` existed: 7 of 8 layers reached the device holding another
layer's weights at ``read_ahead=1``, 6 of 8 at the default 2, 4 of 8 at 4.

One layer spec group is assumed to occupy a CONTIGUOUS run of indices, which
is what ``_build_source`` produces: the decoder layers in order, then the
vocabulary-sized shards one group each. ``_group_bounds`` takes a group's span
from its lowest and highest index, so on a synthetic index whose groups
alternate the span is wider than the membership and the effective lookahead
window halves. That costs depth, never correctness — no wedge, no wrong bytes.

        What "release the rest" may mean depends on how the staging was

        * PAGEABLE staging keeps the implicit release. ``dst.copy_(...,
          non_blocking=True)`` out of pageable memory is host-synchronous, so no
          copy can still be in flight and the contract this design always had —
          a reference from ``get`` is valid until your next ``get`` for a
          different layer — is still true. Every caller that predates this
          source relies on it, including the byte-identity gate, which calls
          ``get`` directly; without it their slots would never come back and the
          reader would stall until ``get``'s 30 s timeout fired. The implicit
          release carries NO drain event, which is correct: a consumer that
          never calls ``release`` never enqueued an asynchronous copy either.
        * PINNED staging REFUSES instead. There the copy is genuinely still
          draining when ``load_async`` returns, so reclaiming the buffer is the
          corruption ``release`` exists to prevent, not a tidy-up. Silently
          doing it is how 6 of 8 layers reached the device holding another
          layer's weights. A loud stop is the only honest answer, because the
          alternative is a wrong gradient with no error anywhere.

        reader made the suite HANG instead of fail.

        Two checks, each for a state that really is reachable:

          ``_run`` is one ``try`` around the whole loop whose only ``return`` is
          guarded by ``self._closed``, and every other exit runs ``_fail``, so
          the thread cannot exit with ``_error`` unset and ``_closed`` False
          through any path in this file. It exists for the ones that are not in
          this file — a monkeypatched ``_run`` in a test, a future edit adding a
          second ``return``, an interpreter that kills the thread — where the
          alternative is a consumer blocking forever on a reader that is not
          there.
        * One read has been in flight past ``_MAX_READ_SECONDS``. THIS is the
          reachable wedge: a reader blocked inside ``read_into`` (a stalled
          drive, a disconnected network path) keeps ``idx`` legitimately
          queued, so no amount of state-inspection can tell it from a slow
          read — only elapsed time can. The stamp covers the drain wait as well
          as the read itself, because it is taken with ``_in_flight``: both are
          time the consumer spends unable to proceed, and charging the wider
          window errs towards firing, which is the safe direction for a
          hang detector carrying a 15x margin.

        A reader that is gone WITHOUT having entered is neither: it died in
        thread bootstrap before ``_run`` began (#1056), so it holds no request,
        no slot and no in-flight read, and starting a fresh one is exact. That
        is bounded by ``_MAX_READER_STARTS`` and ends in its own error, so a

        another layer's weights at the default depth.
